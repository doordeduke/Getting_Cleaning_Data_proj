The compressed (.zip) data folder used in this project is accessible via the above url; its contents are placed in the R home directory.

Accelerometers and gyroscopes in the smartphones recorded the various measurements for each subject at multiple times 
for the same activity; part of the tidying of this data involved averaging the results of each measurement per 
activity per person.
